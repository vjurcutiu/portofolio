The portfolio contains five short, fun projects that I worked on in my spare time:

1. A trading bot that offers trading suggestions using AI.
2. A barcode scanner that uses the built-in webcam of a device.
3. A telegram bot that recommends nearby shops and restaurants based on your input.
4. A trading bot frontend that can be integrated with multiple APIs.
5. A voice assistant frontend that is integrated with the LiveKit API.

The projects can be downloaded and installed locally for testing.
