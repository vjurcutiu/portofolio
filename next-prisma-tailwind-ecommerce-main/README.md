## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Why are there 2 apps in the app folder?

This project is made up of 2 separate apps ( admin and storefront ) which should be deployed separately. If you are deploying with Vercel you should create 2 different apps.

Under the general tab there is a Root Directory option, for the admin app you should put in "apps/admin" and for the storefront app you should put in "apps/storefront".

## üîê Authentication

The authentication is handled using JWT tokens stored in cookies and verified inside the `middleware.ts` file. The middleware function takes in the HTTP request, reads the `token` cookie and if the JWT is successfully verified, it sets the `X-USER-ID` header with the userId as the value, otherwise the request is sent back with 401 status.

## üëÅ‚Äçüó® Environment variables

Environment variables are stored in `.env` files. By default the `.env.example` file is included in source control and contains
settings and defaults to get the app running. Any secrets or local overrides of these values should be placed in a
`.env` file, which is ignored from source control.

Remember, never commit and store `.env` in the source control, just only `.env.example` without any data specified.

You can [read more about environment variables here](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/environment-variables).

## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Getting Started Locally

Clone the repository.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sesto-dev/next-prisma-tailwind-ecommerce
```

Navigate to each folder in the `apps` folder and and set the variables.

```sh
cp .env.example .env
```

Get all dependencies sorted.

```sh
bun install
```

Bring your database to life with pushing the database schema.

```bash
bun run db:push
```

```sh
bun run dev
```

## üîë Database

Prisma ORM can use any PostgreSQL database. [Supabase is the easiest to work with.](https://www.prisma.io/docs/guides/database/supabase) Simply set `DATABASE_URL` in your `.env` file to work.

### `bun run db`

This project exposes a package.json script for accessing prisma via `bun run db:<command>`. You should always try to use this script when interacting with prisma locally.

### Making changes to the database schema

Make changes to your database by modifying `prisma/schema.prisma`.
